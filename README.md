Stats Plus
==========

### About
This mod adds a new panel to the results screen of Risk of Rain 2 that lets you view the progression of a multitude of base-game and custom stats, available for each player. The stats are plotted against total time in an interactive graph, where each record is created at key points in the run (stage beginning and game end).
[Full credit for the Unity graph code goes to PingSharp.](https://github.com/PingSharpCode/Graph)

Additionally, if you want to immortalise your run, you can use the R script generator button to copy code that can turn your run into a HTML page:
